# Running / Viewing the Project
## Eclipse (IDE)
1. First, make sure that you have the Eclipse IDE to run the program. If you need to download Eclipse, the link is provided below. <br/>
   -Eclipse (IDE) Download: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2. Next, make sure that you have Java installed in your system. Go to your settings/system preferences and search for Java in your system. If you do not already have Java installed, follow the link below. The link will bring you to a website for downloading Java. The website will give you the option to download Java for Mac or Windows. <br/>
   -Java Download: https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html
3. On this repository page, go to the "Code" button and click the "Download Zip" option.
4. Go to your "Downloads" section on your computer and place the zip file in a folder/location other than "Downloads".
5. Double click on the zip file to open or "unzip" it so you can access the file contents.
6. Open up Eclipse, and type "Java-Pong-Game" as the name of the workspace. Then click the "launch" button.
7. If any settings options appear, click the "Hide" option located in the upper righthand corner of the screen.
8. You should now see a workspace. You will probably NOT see any files. To get the actual file content into the workspace, click on the "Import projects" option.
9. Click the "General" dropdown arrow option. Then double click "Projects from Folder or Archive". This should open a separate Eclipse window.
10. In the separate Eclipse window, select the "Directory..." button. This should open your file system window. In the file system window, navigate to the location where the "Java-Pong-master" folder is stored. 
11. Select the "Java-Pong-master" folder. Click "Open". This will add the path the the directory in the separate Eclipse window you have opened. 
12. Then in the separate Eclipse window, click "Finish".
13. Open the project folder that should now be in your workspace by double clicking it. Then open the "(default package)" folder by double clicking it.
14. Next, open the "NAMEOFDRIVER.java" file by clicking it. Hit the green run icon, which is a green circle with a white triangle inside of it. The program should run, and you should see a separate window open with the Java Pong Game running on it. 
15. Below the "Command Line" section, see the `Java Pong Game Controls` so that you know how to play the game.

## Command Line
1. First, make sure that you have your terminal open. Information about your terminal can be found here:<br/>
   -Mac: https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac<br/>
   -Windows: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/
2. Next, make sure that you have Java installed in your system. Go to your settings/system preferences (do this on your computer and not in your terminal) and search for Java in your system. If you do not already have Java installed, follow the link below. You will be brought to a website for downloading Java. The website will give you the option to download Java for Mac or Windows. <br/>
   -Java Download: https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html
3. On this repository page, go to the "Code" button and click the "Download Zip" option.
4. Go to your "Downloads" section on your computer and place the zip file in a folder/location other than "Downloads".
5. Double click on the zip file to open or "unzip" it so you can access the file contents.
6. In your opened terminal, navigate to the location where you opened the downloaded zip file and make sure you are inside of the "Java-Pong-master" folder. (If you are unsure of command line commands, see the resources provided bellow.)<br/>
   -Linux and Max: http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html<br/>
   -Windows: https://blogs.umass.edu/Techbytes/2014/11/14/file-navigation-with-windows-command-prompt/
7. Inside the "Java-Pong-master" folder on your terminal, type the following command: `javac NAMEOFDRIVER.java`. It is important that you include the "c" at the end of "java" (no spaces).
8. After typing the command above, type this command: `java NAMEOFDRIVER.java`. Do NOT include a "c" at the end of "java" in this command.
9. After running the command in the previous step, a separate window should open with the Java Pong Game running on it.
